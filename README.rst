Python AppImage Base
====================

This is currently a work in progress.  It builds a "prefix" directory
containing a python installation along with the libraries needed by python
modules.  The directory is meant to be used as the core of a root directory
for an AppImage based on a python application that uses tkinter.  It
supports current versions of Tcl and Tk.

Releases will eventually be built in a manylinux docker image.
